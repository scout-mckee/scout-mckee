# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Scout!
I am a recent graduate from the UBC Master of Data Science program with a background in computational physics and mathematics. My multidisciplinary background has strengthened my ability to tackle complex problems from differnt angles. With a strong foundation data analysis and data science, I excel at breaking down challenging issues and developing data-driven solutions.
## About Me

Education: Master of Data Science, University of British Columbia (UBC)

Interests: Data-driven decision making, data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

Goals: I am currently looking for work and eager to contribute to innovative projects where I can apply my data science expertise.

## What I Do
üßê Data Analysis: analyzing complex datasets to uncover insights and trends.

ü§ñ Machine Learning: building and deploying machine learning models to solve real-world problems.

üé® Data Visualization: creating compelling visualizations to communicate data-driven stories effectively.

## Projects

Here are some notable projects I‚Äôve worked on (check out my profile to see some more!):

**SRK Consulting, Benchmarking Tailings Facilities Risk:** 
- Developed interpretable machine learning and statistical models to evaluate risk in tailings storage facilities (TSF). 
- Capstone project in collaboration with SRK Consulting and a team UBC classmates.

**StFX University Physics Department, An Analysis of the Hydrogen Bond Network in Simulations of Supercooled Water:**
- Used Python and data analysis skills to examine the hydrogen bond network in models of supercooled water. 
- Advanved Major research project in computational physics.
